## 📖 Project Description (The "What")
Project Bazaar is the premier decentralized infrastructure for the Pi Network Open era. It provides a high-performance **Merchant Command** dashboard that allows local sellers to manage real-world trade with blockchain-backed security. 

The core of Bazaar is the **Market Guard** engine, which manages merchant reputations using a proprietary **Trust Variance** system.

* **Seal of Excellence:** Automatically awarded to elite merchants with a score of **+2049**.
* **The Exile Protocol:** Automated system exile for bad actors hitting the **-20 Pi** trust floor.

## 🗺️ Open Network Roadmap (The "Future")

### Phase 1: The Trust Genesis (COMPLETE)
* **Infrastructure:** Merchant Command Mobile Dashboard optimized for S23 displays.
* **Branding:** Vectorized CSS **Seal of Excellence** branding (Zero-404 Architecture).
* **Core Logic:** Deployment of the **-1987 / +2049** Trust Variance engine.

### Phase 2: Ecosystem Integration (Q2 2026)
* **Biometric Sync:** Integrating **Palm-Print Authentication** for high-value merchant verification.
* **Pi DEX Connectivity:** Real-time Pi-to-Liquidity swapping directly within the command center.

### Phase 3: Global Governance (Q4 2026)
* **Bazaar DAO:** Transitioning the **BZR Token** into a governance asset for community-led policy voting.

## ⛓️ Soroban Smart Contract Structure (The "Technical Proof")
This project utilizes the **Stellar Soroban (Rust) SDK** for on-chain trust enforcement and data integrity.

### Core Contract Functions:
* `stake(user, amount)`: Securely locks 20 Pi into the Integrity Vault for 30 days.
* `vouch(voucher, target)`: Peer-to-peer verification that increases the target's Trust Score.
* `decay(target)`: Admin-triggered logic to penalize bad actors and reduce visibility.
* `get_trust(user)`: A read-only function providing the real-time variance score.
